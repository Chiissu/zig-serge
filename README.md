# Zig-Serge

The missing serialization/deserialization library for Zig.

Why Serge? Inside joke.

> This library is in a very early stage. The plan is to create several serializers/deserializers, then extract what is common to become the core library with the rest being a built-in parser.

Current target: Zig 0.11
